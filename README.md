# chess
The Odin Project final Ruby project to create a chess game.

This is a part implementation of the game of chess 
(http://www.chessvariants.com/d.chess/chess.html).

Players moves are specified as the 'from' location followed by the 'to' 
location, where the co-ordinate system goes 'a' to 'h' along the bottom
of the board and 1 to 8 along the left side. For example "e2e4" would 
move white's king's pawn forward two places.

The game recognizes check, checkmate and stalemate positions.
